# General HTTP client for iOS

In this repository you can find **sample HTTPClient** code for **different** cases. 

Following **SOLID** I tried to make an abstraction for **HTTPClient**. 
For the example protocol **HTTPClient** supports **Combine**, **Swift Concurrency** and **Closure**.  

The implementation of HTTPClient is a **URLSession**.

You can choose the way of networking that you like best. 

Repository under **development** and improvement.
